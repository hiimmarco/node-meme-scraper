# Node.js - Meme Scraper

This backend application scrapes memes from the website _memegen-link-examples-upleveled.netlify.app_ and saves it into a folder.
The folder is not visible on github because of copyright issues.

The application is built by Marco Bogner for the purpose of exercising Node.js in a coding bootcamp.
